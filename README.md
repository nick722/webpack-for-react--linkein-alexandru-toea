Описание: Discover how to optimize your web applications using the webpack JavaScript module bundler. In this project-based course, Alexandru Toea demonstrates how to take a preexisting React application—along with basic webpack configuration—and apply advanced features such as code splitting. He also demonstrates how to install Babel and add it to your webpack application, as well as how to deploy your application to dynamic cloud hosting sites such as AWS in order to improve the existing application. Upon completing this course, you'll have the knowledge you need to configure webpack and use it to develop high-quality React apps at a faster pace.
